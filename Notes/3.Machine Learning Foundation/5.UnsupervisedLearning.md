# Unsupervised Machine Learning

In this lesson, we will learn about unsupervised machine learning. Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where there are no labeled outputs. The algorithm learns the patterns and relationships in the data and groups similar data items.

In unsupervised machine learning, the patterns in the data are explored explicitly without being told what to look for. For example, if you give a set of different colored LEGO pieces to a child and ask it to group them, it may group the LEGO pieces based on any patterns they observe. It can be based on same color, same size, or same type.

Similarly, in unsupervised learning, we group unlabeled data sets. One more example could be: imagine you have a basket of various fruits—say, apples, bananas, and oranges—and your task is to group these fruits based on their similarities. You observe that some fruits are round and red, while others are elongated and yellow.

Without being told explicitly, you decide to group the round and red fruits together as one cluster, and the elongated and yellow fruits as another cluster. There you go. You have just performed an unsupervised learning task.

## Clustering

Clustering is a method of grouping data items based on similarities. Within a cluster, the data items are more similar than the items outside the cluster. If some data items do not fall within any cluster, these data items are deemed as outlier points. For example, grapes have a different shape, size, and color compared to apples, pears, and strawberries, and hence could be an outlier.

Having seen what clustering is, let us explore some of its important use cases.

### Use Cases of Unsupervised Machine Learning

1. **Market Segmentation**  
   In market segmentation, one example is providing the purchasing details of an online shop to a clustering algorithm. Based on the items purchased and purchasing behavior, the clustering algorithm can identify customers based on the similarity between the products purchased. For example, customers in a particular age group who buy protein diet products can be targeted with advertisements for sports-related products.

2. **Outlier Analysis**  
   One typical example for outlier analysis is to provide credit card purchase data for clustering. Fraudulent transactions can be detected by a bank by identifying outliers. In some transactions, amounts are too high or recurring, which signifies an outlier.

3. **Recommendation Systems**  
   An example for recommendation systems is providing users' movie viewing history as input to a clustering algorithm. It clusters users based on the type or rating of movies they have watched.  
   The output helps provide personalized movie recommendations to users, for example, Netflix. The same applies for music recommendations as well.

## Steps Involved in Unsupervised Machine Learning

Before that, we need to understand the concept of similarity.

### Similarity

Similarity measures how close two data points are to each other and is a value between zero and one. Similarity between objects decides which cluster they will fall into, and hence is important for clustering.

Now, suppose from a basket of fruits, we need to identify similar fruits based on color. Then apple and cherry are similar to each other based on color. The higher the similarity between objects, the closer the value is to one. So for apple and cherry, in this case, similarity would have a value closer to one.

There are various types of similarity measures used in clustering. Some common similarity metrics frequently used are:
- Euclidean distance metric
- Manhattan distance metric
- Cosine similarity matrix
- Jaccard similarity matrix

### Workflow of Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

Just like supervised learning, unsupervised learning follows a workflow to cluster data. For example, using the fruits data, the following steps are followed:

1. **Prepare the data**  
   While preparing the data, basic preprocessing steps like removing missing values, normalizing the data, and feature scaling are performed.

2. **Create similarity matrix**  
   The choice of which similarity matrix to use depends on the nature of the data and the specific clustering algorithm being used.

3. **Run the clustering algorithm**  
   Clustering algorithms use the similarity matrix to cluster the data. Different types of clustering algorithms include partition-based, hierarchical-based, density-based, and distribution-based.

4. **Interpret the results and adjust your clustering**  
   Checking the quality of your clustering output is iterative and exploratory. Because there is no labeled output, clustering lacks the ground truth that can verify the output.  
   Verify the results against expectations at the cluster level and the example level. Improving the result requires iteratively experimenting with the previous steps to see how they affect the clustering.

Thanks for watching.
