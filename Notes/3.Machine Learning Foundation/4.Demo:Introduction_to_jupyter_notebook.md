# üì¶ Introduction to Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook

Hello, and welcome again to our course on **OCI Foundations**.  
Before we dive into a machine learning use case, let's first explore a **powerful tool every aspiring data scientist should know**: **Anaconda**.

---

## üêç What is Anaconda?

**Anaconda** is an **open-source distribution** of **Python** and **R**, specifically designed for:

- Data science  
- Machine learning  
- Scientific computing

Think of it as a **toolbox preloaded with all the essential libraries and environments** you‚Äôll need to kick-start your journey into data science and machine learning.

## ‚úÖ Why Use Anaconda?

Here are some key advantages:

### 1. üì¶ Easy Package Management
- Simplifies installing, updating, and managing Python/R libraries (like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, etc.)

### 2. üß™ Environment Isolation
- Create **isolated environments** for each project
- Avoid conflicts between different package versions

### 3. üß≠ Anaconda Navigator
- **User-friendly interface** (no need for command line)
- Manage environments, install packages, launch tools like **Jupyter Notebooks**

### 4. üíª Cross-platform Support
- Available on **Windows**, **Mac**, and **Linux**

## üìì What is Jupyter Notebook?

**Jupyter Notebook** is an **interactive development environment (IDE)** used for:

- Writing and running live code  
- Displaying equations, visualizations, and narrative text  
- Ideal for **data exploration**, **prototyping**, and **interactive presentations**

## üöÄ Launching Jupyter Notebook

When you launch Jupyter Notebook:
- A **local server** runs on your machine
- A browser tab opens with a dashboard interface

### Tabs:
- **Files**: Shows files/folders
- **Running**: Displays open notebooks and terminals
- **Clusters**: (Advanced - for parallel processing; out of scope for now)

## üìÅ Creating a New Project

1. **Create a folder**: Click `New` > `Folder`  
   - Rename it to `ML Demo`

2. **Open the folder**: Double-click on `ML Demo`
   - It will say *"Notebook list is empty"*

3. **Create a new notebook**: Click `New` > `Python 3 (ipykernel)`
   - A new notebook opens in a new tab

4. **Rename the notebook**:
   - Click on `Untitled`
   - Rename it to `ML Demo 1`

## üß™ Writing and Running Code

Let‚Äôs write a simple Python program in Jupyter Notebook:

```python
# This program adds two numbers
num1 = 1
num2 = 4

# Add two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

Run the cell using:

#‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run button

#or Shift + Enter

print("The sum of {} and {} is {}".format(num1, num2, sum))

The sum of 1 and 4 is 5

```
